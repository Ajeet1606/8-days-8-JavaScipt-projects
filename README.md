# 8-days-8-JavaScript-Projects

When I started learning JavaScript, after completing fundamentals, I started building projects on play. 

Followed the FreeCodeCamp Youtube channel, found some cool ideas to begin with, so build 8 projects for fun.


I've deployed each project on netlify:

- [Color Flipper](https://colour-flipper-project.netlify.app/):
    It's a JavaScript project to change background colors of page on button clicks and shows the color code.

- [Counter](https://manual-counter-project.netlify.app/): It's a manual counter project, which has 3 buttons for increasing, decresing and resetting value.
- [Reviews](https://reviews-lists.netlify.app/): It's a short project to display testimonials.
- [NavBar](https://navbar-html-css.netlify.app/): A Simple NavBar built with HTML & CSS.

- [SideBar](https://interesting-sidebar.netlify.app/): An interesting sidebar, which is hidden on load, we can choose to show or hide.
- [FAQs](https://faqs-list.netlify.app/): showing multiples FAQs with some sort of animation. 

- [Menu Items](https://showing-menu-items.netlify.app/): It shows some menu items present in the hotel, we can choose the categories a/c to our need.

- [Grocery Buddy](https://grocerry-buddyyy.netlify.app/): Beautiful UI project, which stores groceries to buy, it has CRUD operations implemented and data is saved after reload also..
